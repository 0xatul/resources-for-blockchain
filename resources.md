## Smart Contracts!

Warning: Its not beginner friendly, I recommend learning JavaScript and doing some projects can help you expand.

### Smart contracts are no different than typical web pentesting except for the fact it is decentralized and runs on a blockchain(Ethereum in this case) . Learn how blockchain works:
- [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper)
- [How does Ethereum work anyway?](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369)
- [Blockchain Explained](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)

### Learn Solidity and learn to look at the code in a security standpoint:
- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/solidity/)
- [RTFM](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html)
- [Crypto Zombies(It's more fun this way)](https://cryptozombies.io/)
- [Here's another guide](https://eattheblocks.com/best-way-to-learn-solidity-for-beginners/)
- [Look at best practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)

### Practice some stuff:
- [DVWA of smart contracts](https://github.com/mixbytes/DVESC)
- [(Not So) Smart Contracts](https://github.com/crytic/not-so-smart-contracts)

### Play CTFs 
- [Capture the ether] (https://capturetheether.com/challenges/)
- [Ethernaut] (https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)

### [DASP Top 10](https://dasp.co/)
### Look at disclosed reports, Here are my favoriate ones
- [$50k Improper Input Validation](https://hackerone.com/reports/684092)
- [$25k Inti bug](https://hackerone.com/reports/672664)
- [$10k Improper Input Validation](https://hackerone.com/reports/684152)
